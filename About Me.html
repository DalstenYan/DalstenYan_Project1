    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>I'm a 20 year old undergraduate pursuing Computer Information Systems 
      Bachelor's Degree with a minor in Game Development. I have loved CS ever
      since I was a kid and discovered computers for the first time.
      <br><br>Watching how cashier registers operate, 
      our everday appliances slowly being modernized with touchscreens & buttons, 
      and also when I was able to play a videogame for the first time, opened me up to this exciting new world.
      I started coding and programming in High School, and dedicated lots of time towards
      coding projects whenever I could.
